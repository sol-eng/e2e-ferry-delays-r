This is an easier-to-demo, thinned down version of the project work from the 
posit::conf(2024) workshop [Data Science Workflows with Posit Tools - R Focus](https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/ds-workflows-r).

This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflows with an example 
project of predicting ferry delays.

The project includes:

-   01 - Ingestion of raw data from an API source
-   02 - Ad hoc data exploration using `pointblank`
-   03 - Data validation using `pointblank` and conditional email alerting using Quarto
-   04 - Model development and deployment using `vetiver`, `plumber`, and `pins`
-   05 - Delivering insights using an interactive Shiny app
-   06 - Employing the `connectapi` Posit SDK to monitor content usage
